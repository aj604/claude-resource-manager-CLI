# Claude Resource Manager CLI - Project Plan & Timeline

**Project Manager:** ProductVisionary
**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Project Duration:** 4 weeks (160 hours)
**Team:** Single full-time developer
**Deliverable:** Production-ready CLI v1.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a 4-week implementation timeline for converting the existing Node.js resource manager to a high-performance Go CLI tool with TUI capabilities. The project follows an agile approach with weekly sprints, clear milestones, and comprehensive risk management.

**Key Constraints:**

**Strategic Approach:**
- Build CLI-first (Weeks 1-3), optional MCP wrapper later
- Test-driven development from day 1
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Weekly demos and feedback loops

### External Blockers

**Potential Blockers:**

1. **GitHub API Rate Limits**
   - Impact: Catalog sync failures during testing
   - Mitigation: Use authenticated requests, implement caching, use fixtures
   - Owner: Developer
   - Timeline: Not blocking (fixtures available)

2. **Homebrew Formula Approval**
   - Impact: Delayed distribution via Homebrew
   - Mitigation: Submit early, have direct download fallback
   - Owner: Homebrew maintainers
   - Timeline: Week 4, non-blocking for v1.0 release

3. **Cross-Platform Build Issues**
   - Impact: Windows/Linux builds may fail
   - Mitigation: Test early with GitHub Actions, use Go's standard library
   - Owner: Developer
   - Timeline: Week 4, critical for release

4. **Catalog Format Changes**
   - Impact: Breaking changes to YAML structure
   - Mitigation: Coordinate with Node.js sync script maintainer
   - Owner: Repository maintainer
   - Timeline: Week 1, critical dependency

## Project Governance

### Decision Authority

**Product Decisions:**
- Product Manager (ProductVisionary): Feature prioritization, scope, roadmap
- Developer: Technical implementation choices, architecture

- Technical blockers: Developer → Architect → CTO
- Scope changes: Developer → Product Manager → Stakeholders
- Timeline issues: Product Manager → Program Manager

### Change Control

**Scope Changes:**
1. Submit change request with justification
2. Impact analysis (time, risk, dependencies)
3. Approval required from Product Manager
4. Update project plan and communicate

**Minor Changes:**
- Small UI tweaks: Developer discretion
- Bug fixes: Always approved
- Refactoring: Developer discretion if no scope impact

**Major Changes:**
- New features: Requires approval + timeline review
- Architecture changes: Requires design review
- Removing features: Requires stakeholder approval
