"""Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Test Suite - RED Phase.

This test suite defines accessibility compliance behaviors BEFORE implementation.
All tests are EXPECTED to FAIL initially - this is the RED phase of TDD.

WCAG 2.1 AA Criteria Tested:
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): Text contrast >= 4.5:1 (normal), >= 3:1 (large)
- 2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality available via keyboard
- 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: Can move away from all components
- 2.4.3 Focus Order: Logical focus order
- 3.3.1 Error Identification: Errors clearly identified
- 3.3.3 Error Suggestion: Error correction suggested
- 4.1.3 Status Messages: Screen reader announcements

Current Status: 78% WCAG compliance
Target: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

Test Categories:
1. Screen Reader Announcements (8 tests) - ARIA live regions
2. Color Contrast (7 tests) - WCAG contrast ratios
3. Keyboard Navigation (6 tests) - Keyboard trap prevention
4. Error Recovery (4 tests) - Enhanced error handling

Total: 25 tests
