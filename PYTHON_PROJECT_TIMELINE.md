## Adjusted Python Timeline

### Total Duration: 5 Weeks (200 hours)

**Why 25% Longer Than Go:**
1. **Performance Optimization** (+20h): Python requires careful profiling and optimization
2. **Packaging Complexity** (+15h): PyInstaller/Nuitka setup and testing
3. **Type Hints** (+8h): Comprehensive typing for maintainability
4. **TUI Learning Curve** (+10h): Textual is newer, less documented
5. **Testing Overhead** (+7h): Slower test execution, more mocking needed
6. **Buffer** (-20h): Offset by Python development familiarity

## Recommendations

### Should We Use Python or Go?

**Python Recommended If:**
- Team has strong Python expertise
- Performance targets are flexible (100ms startup OK)
- Rapid iteration is priority
- Integration with Python ecosystem needed
- Rich documentation/examples important

**Go Recommended If:**
- Performance is critical (<10ms startup required)
- Single binary distribution essential
- Team has Go expertise
- Long-term maintenance priority
- Cross-platform deployment critical

### Final Recommendation: **Go**

**Rationale:**
1. **Performance Requirements:** 10ms startup is aggressive, Python struggles
2. **Distribution Simplicity:** Single Go binary vs complex Python packaging
3. **User Experience:** Faster response times = better UX
4. **Maintenance:** Type safety and fast tests = fewer bugs
5. **Timeline:** Go is 20% faster to market (4 vs 5 weeks)

**However, Python is viable if:**
- We accept 100ms startup (still fast for humans)
- We have Python experts available
- We value ecosystem integration over performance
